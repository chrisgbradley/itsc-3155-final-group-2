# Higher Education Statistics Since 1996
## ITSC 3155 Final Project Proposal

### 1. Introduction

When searching for college statistics like admission rate, tuition costs, GPA information, etc… there isn’t a singular source that presents this information in an easily digestible format. Our goal is to create an easy to use dashboard with multiple filters that let you view a variety of college information to help you make an informed decision when choosing a college to attend. Our reasoning behind the need for this is a severe lack of credible usage of education that contributes to poor decisions in education infrastructure and planning. Wide access to credible data that is presented in an unbiased way is necessary for prudent decision making from the student level to the university level to the lawmaker level.

#### 1.1 Product Vision

Our goal is to utilize open source data provided by all universities in the US to the Department of Education and the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development to create a multilayer dashboard that allows a variety of end-users from all different backgrounds to see quality representations of data that help them see trends and make decisions accordingly. This would include data that would help students make choices between colleges and universities based on their admittance information and information on the graduating classes in the past. This would give students an idea of the competitiveness of the schools and their chances of getting admitted. For policy makers, using this information allows insight into the trajectory of tuition, how much federal grant money is provided and the amount of money provided in the form of subsidized and unsubsidized loans for students year over year. This information is invaluable in the long term decision making of the US Legislature.
