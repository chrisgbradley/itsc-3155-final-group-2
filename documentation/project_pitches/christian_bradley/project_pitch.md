# Product Pitch
---
Hi, my name is Christian Bradley and I'm here to tell you that college sucks. But, it doesn't have to.

My team and I want to provide context to the wealth of data that the Department of Education gathers each year only for it to largely sit in databases unused and uninterpreted. We plan to shine a light on this data to raise awareness and provide data to prospective students, researchers, policymakers, and accreditation boards about the rise of tuition costs of schools, the SAT and ACT score of student being admitted, the GPA of students graduating and the amount of federal loan and grant money being provided to cover students' costs while in school.

Providing this resource would shape the decisions made later by making problem areas clear and provide the information needed to plan a solution.
