# Product Pitch
---
College years are among the most defining in our lives, and the choices we make during those years will have lifelong ramifications that none of us can predict. It is imperative then that students can get the information they need to choose which college is right for them, which is where our product comes in. Currently, vital information regarding colleges is spread out over numerous websites and databases all over the internet. When a prospective student is comparing dozens of different schools, the process of retrieving all relevant information can be quite overwhelming. With our product we plan on creating a singular up to date database containing all of the most important information for choosing a potential college. Stats like GPA, Tuition, Average SAT scores, and more will all be viewable in a number of easily digestible formats. Beyond the numbers our dashboard interface will allow students to keep track of schools they are interested in and quickly compare schools in order to choose the best option. With all this we hope to simplify the college search by giving students the tools and information they need to make the educated choice.
