				EduWatch was created with the vision of compiling information on the nation's top schools
				into one convenient place. We, third and fourth year computer science students, felt it important
				to create a place for prospective and current students to view information relevant to their
				college career in a way that is both easily digestible and highly specific.
				To this end, we provide many viewing formats for our data.

				Our goal is to provide you with the data you need to make an informed choice with your education.
				Important college statistics are spread out over the internet, but here at EduWatch we have compiled
				the most important data from the Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development (OPEPD) and
				made it as easy to understand as possible.

			<p>
				From the College Scorecard data, you'll be able to find data on completion rates based on gender,
				types of degrees being completed, transfer rates, acceptance/exit/completion rates, tuition costs,
				tuition costs based on income, and more. This data set comprises just under 2500 data points, gathered
				from nearly 5000 universities since 1996 across the entire United States, territories, and major
				outlying islands.

					An aside from the project authors: <br>
					As this project is a proof-of-concept, this data is applicable in many more ways that what has been
					done. Given more time, we would expand on the data presented with more detailed interactions and
					provide more charts, expanding on unused portions of the College Scorecard data.
